##### Discord.Net.Bot - A small library used to make a base bot in seconds.

This package was created to speed up creation of bots for myself. Released to help anyone else who would benefit. Uses NuGet package Discord.Net but has no affiliation with Discord.Net. If outdated, feel free to contribute and create a pull request to update to latest Discord.Net version.

### Example project
You can use the example project below, however it is not updated since v2.3.0, it should still work if the NuGet package is updated. The library itself is the only thing that changed. You can also look at the test bot in this repo.

An example project that uses the Discord.Net.Bot package is Lori's Angel. Lori's Angel is a bot that adds fun commands and games such as connect 4 with rendered game boards. You can invite Lori's Angel to your Discord Guild here: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=729696788097007717&scope=bot&permissions=44032
