# bBotLibrary
Discord.Net.Bot - A small library used to make a base bot in seconds.

This package was created to speed up creation of bots for myself. Released to help anyone else who would benefit.
If outdated, feel free to contribute and create a pull request to update to latest Discord.Net version.

### Example project
An example project that uses the Discord.Net.Bot package is Lori's Angel. Lori's Angel is a bot that adds fun commands and games such as connect 4 with rendered game boards. You can invite Lori's Angel to your Discord Guild here: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=729696788097007717&scope=bot&permissions=44032

Another example project that is just a basic bot will be added to the solution soon.
